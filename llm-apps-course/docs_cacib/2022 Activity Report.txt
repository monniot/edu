Editorial:
"All over the world, a growing number of voices are calling for a low-carbon economy, better preservation of the environment and biodiversity, and greater social inclusion."
Philippe Brassac Chairman of the Board of Directors of Crédit Agricole CIB

Crédit Agricole Group’s results for 2022 once again strengthen our position as a leading bank in France and in Europe: our capital, profitability, operational efficiency and risk coverage ratios demonstrate our strength and competitiveness. These results are remarkable given the environment in which we operate.
The current period remains characterised by uncertain-ties due to the return of inflation, the energy crisis and monetary policies. All these crises have left their mark on this year, the most dramatic being of course the conflict in Ukraine which has upset the geopolitical situation. In spite of the lack of visibility created by these short term changes, our long term future has never been so clear, nor has there ever been so much consensus surrounding it.
All over the world, a growing number of voices are call-ing for a low-carbon economy, better preservation of the environment and biodiversity, and greater social inclu-sion. In this specific context, our roadmap, revealed last June with our new strategic plan, sets a clear course and demonstrates our ambitions to truly facilitate, and even amplify, these transitions. It reaffirms our usefulness.
Our universal customer-focused banking model allows us to support our clients and to help them face all the transformations they have to deal with. At its own level, Crédit Agricole CIB cultivates our mission to be useful in all the regions in which the Bank operates: useful to the Group and its clients, by providing its expertise throughout the world, whether to midcaps companies or to large international groups. Useful to the economy, by supporting all sectors of activity and building long-term relationships with its clients, based on trust and transpar-ency. Useful to society, by being a key player in financing the energy transition.
Our Group project is powerful because it is inspired by the conviction that our business development has a specific purpose, to serve the environment in which we operate. In this sense, it is consistent with our Mission, which is to act every day in the interest of our clients and society.


"With this new roadmap we are restating our commitment to serve our clients and society to the best of our abilities by accompanying them in their main transitions: environmental, human and digital."
Xavier Musca Chief Executive Officer of Crédit Agricole CIB

In spite of a difficult environment impacted by the conflict in Ukraine, the health crisis, and greater market volatility partly due to changes in monetary policy, Crédit Agricole CIB generated outstanding revenues in 2022. Our CIB reported a Net Income Group Share of EUR 1,530 million, up 2% com-pared to 2021. We have achieved all the goals set for the year in our strategic plan. Once again, we have shown our ability to overcome crises thanks to the strength of our business model. Our Bank demonstrated its agility and was able to carry out great transactions in all its busi-ness lines and regions.
In 2023, we will remain vigilant in order to face the ongoing economic and geopolitical uncertainties. We have defined a trajectory: the “2025 Ambitions” strategic plan which is part of the Group project. With this new roadmap we are restating our commitment to serve our clients and society to the best of our abilities by accom-panying them in their main transitions: environmental, human and digital.
Indeed, for many years we have been committed to the fight against climate change and are keen to help our clients and society move towards a low-carbon economy through our financings and advisory services. This year, with the commitments announced in December 2022 by the Crédit Agricole Group, Crédit Agricole CIB has defined ambitious goals to reduce its carbon footprint by 2030 in the most carbon-intensive sectors of its portfolio. They will be completed in 2023 by new commitments in new sectors, with the constant ambition to follow a net zero trajectory reducing our direct and indirect footprint.
We also want to be a responsible employer and support all our stakeholders in their transitions, by encouraging autonomy and empowerment and by accompanying the transformation of our organisations.
Finally, we are putting digital transformation at the centre of our strategy. We want to offer a unique client experi-ence and modernise our product offering and processes to improve our efficiency and agility.
For this we can count on our pioneering position in the area of sustainable finance, on the long-term expertise of our teams, especially in the financing of real assets, and of course on the strength of Crédit Agricole Group’s universal banking model.

OUR ECONOMISTS’ VIEWS: Isabelle Job-Bazille (Group Chief Economist) and Jean-François Paren (Head of Global Markets Research, Crédit Agricole CIB)
Our central scenario revolves around the assumption that the conflict between Ukraine and Russia remains intense and a peace process distant. While there are traces of inflation everywhere, there are more and more signs that it is beginning to ease both in the United States and Europe against a backdrop of lower tensions in global supply chains and falling commodity prices.

If there are no new price shocks, this easing could intensify in the second half of the year due to strong base effects and the expected cooling of the global economy. In the meantime, cen-tral banks, which have made the fight against inflation a priority, will pursue their monetary tightening policy, albeit at a slower pace, in order to consolidate the disinflation process.
In other words, while 2022 was by inflation, worries for 2023 will focus on the magnitude and char-acteriseddura-tion of the slowdown. The US Federal Reserve’s aggressive monetary policy should therefore constrain spending and lead to a recession by the middle of the year, which should be both light and brief, reducing annual growth to around 1% in 2023 and gradually suppressing inflation.
In a sluggish global economy, growth in emerging countries will struggle to gain momen-tum, especially as traces of the inflationary shock remain and global monetary tightening increases financial pressures. This global picture hides significant disparities: energy-producing countries are still benefiting from high fossil fuel prices; Asia is proving to be an alternative to sourcing from China; Latin America is suffering from the fall in the price of exported raw materials and its fiscal constraints are increasing; while Central and Eastern European countries, close to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, and low-income countries are suffering more, with, for the latter, food security issues linked to socio-political risks. For China, the end of the zero-Covid strat-egy and the reopening of its economy are double-edged. On the one hand, the expected rebound in activity will act as a buffer during the global cooling phase. On the other hand, 
China’s very com-modity-intensive growth could slow the disinflation process and increase compe-tition in the liquefied natural gas market.
In Europe, however, the much-feared energy crisis is less severe than initially expected. Mild winter weather, the diver-sification of gas supply sources and the efforts of households and companies to reduce consumption have all lowered the pressure on energy markets and removed the threat of forced rationing. In addition, sectors such as the auto-motive and aeronautics industries, which were heavily impacted by global logistics problems during and after Covid, have returned to growth, thus supporting industrial production indices. Caution is nevertheless required. While in 2022 many companies, particularly the most energy-intensive ones, were relatively immune thanks to hedging contracts, their energy bills are likely to rise sharply in 2023, which could squeeze margins and profits. Combined with the tightening of financial condi-tions as the ECB increases interest rates, a slowdown in investment remains likely. While the inflation peak is behind us, the impact of past price increases will con-tinue to weigh on household purchasing power and thus on consumption, at a time when governments are being forced to further target their support measures. Overall, while the euro zone should in the end avoid a recession, growth should remain sluggish and vul-nerable to the slightest shock.
As fears of a strong energy crisis faded during the first weeks of January, risk appetite quickly increased, even for the riskiest assets which benefited from strong demand.
Following a very steep rise in interest rates in 2022, which seriously under-mined performance and almost shut down the primary market, fixed income regained its status as a safe haven in 2023 and the interest of investors. The combination of higher interest rates and wider spreads created a very strong appeal for the euro credit market in particular.
After just one month, financial assets’ return on investment was above 15% for the Eurostoxx 50 and more than 2% in the Corporate credit market (com-pared with losses of around 13% for the two asset classes in 2022). This record performance does not seem compatible with the low visibility of the economy in general (inflation and job market are much stronger than antici-pated by the market and central banks).
What about the rest of the year? As we write this, three scenarios remain possible. The first scenario, is a period of stagflation sustained by a very tight labor market requiring a new wave of interest rate rises. This is a possibility in particular because of China’s reopen-ing and the impacts this could have on energy prices in particular. The second scenario is a steep fall in consumption linked to loss of purchasing power (especially in the United States if the real estate market were to fall follow-ing a rise in interest rates) leading to a stronger than expected economic slow-down. The first European consumption indicators for December seem much less resilient. Finally, the third scenario of a moderate economic slowdown accompanied by a gradual decline of interest rates with no major impact on consumption or on the performance of the private sector also remains possible.
These three scenarios imply radically different monetary and fiscal policies, interest rate levels, credit spreads, valuation multiples and risk appetite levels, and therefore a high level of volatility until the economy reaches its stabilisation point. Because visibility is slow to improve for the key factors of the economy (United States: absorption of excess savings in the second quarter; Europe: sustained drop in inflation not before the fourth quarter; China: impact of consumption recovery on energy prices in the third quarter), static posi-tions are unlikely to yield the best results at the end of the year.

HIGHLIGHTS
Strengthening Crédit Agricole’s M&A offering for its SME and MSC clients:
Crédit Agricole confirmed in its Group Project its ambition to be the main partner for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and mid-sized companies (MSCs), and reorganised its M&A activity to improve the coverage of all its clients, from SMEs to large companies.
SODICA Corporate Finance, which specialises in M&A advisory services and financial and stock market engineering for SMEs and MSCs, changed its name to Crédit Agricole Midcap Advisors. Now part of the Group’s MSC division within Crédit Agricole CIB, Crédit Agricole Midcap Advisors has a coordinated commercial approach – in particular with the Regional Banks, LCL and the Group’s other subsidiaries – in order to improve its support for the managers and shareholders of SMEs and MSCs. It will also take advantage of Crédit Agricole CIB’s regional coverage in France, international network and sector expertise.

Crédit Agricole CIB acts as advisor for the largest fibre financing in Germany
Deutsche Glasfaser Group (DGF) secured a €5.75 Bn loan to fund its fibre rollout plans. It is the largest Fibre-to-the-Home (FTTH) financing in Germany to date and the 2nd largest in Europe. Deutsche Glasfaser Group is Germany’s main independent fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) operator. It focuses on poorly served rural and suburban areas, with a network covering 1.1 million FTTH homes. The new funding will support DGF’s project to connect approximately 4 million homes with FTTH by the end of 2025.
The syndication was carried out with several banks and institutional investors. This transaction is the largest digital infrastructure financing in Germany and the second largest in Europe. It is therefore a major achievement and acknowledgement for Crédit Agricole CIB’s technology, media and telecommunications (TMT) advisory and debt finance franchise.


Crédit Agricole CIB improves its Cash Management offering by partnering with Trustpair
To help its clients secure their banking transactions in international markets, Crédit Agricole CIB formed a partnership with the fintech Trustpair, which specialises in supplier and client risk management, the fight against transfer fraud and process digitisation.
This partnership is in line with Crédit Agricole CIB’s strategy of continuously developing its Cash Management offering and will allow the Bank’s clients to benefit from a complete range of services aimed at strengthening the security of their transactions; in addition to all the security, control and traceability tools already offered.

Crédit Agricole CIB secures its first public-private partnership (PPP) financing in the Norwegian market
Crédit Agricole CIB successfully finalised its first motorway PPP project in the Norwegian market, acting as mandated lead arranger in a financing of approximately NOK 8 billion. The RV555 motorway project is the fifth PPP project awarded by the Norwegian Public Roads Administration. It includes the development of approximately 40 km of roads, a four-lane bridge of approximately 900 meters and four new twin-tube road tunnels. The project is seen as essential infrastructure to ensure the continued and sustainable growth of the region.
The aim is to improve traffic safety and regularity in the country by replacing existing obsolete and saturated infrastructure. This transaction confirms Crédit Agricole CIB’s position as a key global player in infrastructure projects and strengthens its expertise in the road PPP sector.

The European Commission raises 8 billion euros as part of the NextGenerationEU programme
On 12 July, the European Commission issued EUR 8 billion in a two-tranche transaction undertaken as part of NextGenerationEU, the stimulus scheme. This transaction is the 11th syndicated transaction carried out as part of NextGenerationEU (NGEU), as well as the first transaction of the Commission’s 2022 financing plan, announced on 24 June 2022. It consists of a new EUR 5 billion 7-year bond maturing on 4 December 2029 and a EUR 3 billion top-up of an existing 20-year bond maturing on 4 July 2041. Crédit Agricole CIB was mandated as joint bookrunner for this transaction.
In 2022, the Commission raised around EUR 50 billion under the NGEU programme, with additional funding of EUR 9 billion for macro-financial assistance (MFA) loans to support Ukraine; and up to EUR 6.6 billion for loans under the European Instrument for Emergency Unemployment Risk Reduction (SURE) programme.


A EUR 1.6 BN TRANSACTION IN THE FIBRE SECTOR FOR VAUBAN INFRASTRUCTUREPARTNERS AND BOUYGUES TELECOM
Crédit Agricole CIB acted as an advisor to Vauban Infrastructure Partners in forming – a recently created joint venture owned by Vauban and Bouygues Telecom – and successfully completed the syndication of a EUR 1.6 billion financing.This transaction demonstrates Crédit Agricole CIB’s continued leadership in the European TMT sector. It is a key milestone for Vauban Infrastructure Partners, making Vauban Infra Fibre the first independent platform to offer broadband access all over France through its various subsidiaries. It is also strategic for Bouygues Telecom, which has now fully secured its FTTH access across all French regions.SDFAST (Société de Développement de la Fibre Au Service des Territoires)

Crédit Agricole CIB is Bouygues’ financial advisor for the acquisition of Equans
Crédit Agricole CIB acted as Bouygues’ financial advisor for its historic acquisition from Engie of Equans, its large multi-technical services entity. This transaction makes Bouygues a world leader in the dynamic multi-technical services market, whose activities are at the centre of the environmental, industrial and digital transitions. They offer solutions for optimising energy consumption, which is crucial in the current environment. This transaction is the largest acquisition ever made by Bouygues. It also illustrates the close ties between Crédit Agricole CIB and Bouygues and is a landmark transaction that highlights the Bank’s expertise in the industry and services sector.



Speeding up the environmental and social transition:
Crédit Agricole CIB wants to remain a leading player in the green transition by helping its clients move towards low carbon sources of energy and by committing to preserve biodiversity.

A commitment to the climate 
Aligning on a net zero trajectory

In order to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement and the major challenges created by climate change, Crédit Agricole CIB made increasingly strong commitments in recent years to speed up the transformation of the economy.

At the end of 2021, as part of Crédit Agricole Group’s collective mobilisation around its Social Project (a real programme that revolves around three priorities: climate, social cohesion, and Agricultural and agri-food transitions)
Crédit Agricole CIB reinforced its commitments to the climate and to supporting its clients in their energy transition and decarbonisation strategy.

The Bank strengthened its sector policies* linked to unconventional hydrocarbons and the protection of the Arctic.
Furthermore, Crédit Agricole CIB made a commitment to reduce its exposure to oil extraction by 20% between 2020 and 2025 and to increase its exposure to low-carbon energy (production and storage) by 60% over the same period.

To take the transformation of its business model even further, Crédit Agricole CIB adopted in 2022 a new Strategic Plan “Ambitions 2025”, which is part of the Group’s Project. 
In this plan the Bank confirms its commitment to serve its clients and society as best as possible by supporting them in their main transitions, particularly the environmental transition.

With this new plan, the aim is to provide clients and society with the best possible support towards carbon neutrality and to make a commitment to protect the environment and biodiversity. 
In line with this approach and as part of its membership of the Net Zero Banking Alliance, the Crédit Agricole Group defined decarbonisation trajectories to 2030 for five priority sectors (oil and gas, automotive, commercial real estate, power generation and cement). 
Crédit Agricole CIB made a strong contribution to the Group’s efforts and strengthened its commitment to reduce its exposure to oil extraction and production, rising this target to 25% between 2020 and 2025 (versus 20%).

Supporting clients in their decarbonisation and environmental preservation efforts
In March 2022, LCL and Crédit Agricole CIB launched the first carbon offset structured product eligible to the European Benchmark label, which includes a mechanism to offset the resid-ual carbon emissions of an investment. LCL and Crédit Agricole CIB included an offset mechanism for the residual emis-sions of the investment by supporting the Yedeni project in Ethiopia, which aims to reduce deforestation in the Bale ecoregion.
In the Americas, the Bank supported the Oriental Republic of Uruguay in launch-ing the first ever “Sustainability-linked” sovereign bond, whose coupon increases or decreases depending on the country’s environmental performance: reduction of greenhouse gas emissions on the one hand and preservation of the primary forest area on the other.
In Asia, Crédit Agricole CIB participated in the first blue and sustainable Dim Sum bond issued by a Chinese local authority. Hainan is located at the southern end of mainland China and has the largest marine area in the country. The funds will be used for ocean-related projects such as clean water, shipping and port logis-tics, fisheries and seafood value chain, and marine ecosystem restoration.
Floating offshore wind farms are part of a promising emerging sector to develop offshore wind projects where the sea is too deep for fixed foundation structures. It is also a sector in which the Bank is very active. Crédit Agricole CIB sup-ported Ørsted in the sale of a 50% stake in the Hornsea 2 offshore wind farm located off the Yorkshire coast in the UK. With a capacity of 1.3 gigawatts (GW), Hornsea 2 will provide enough green electricity to power the equivalent of over 1.3 million homes per year.


A WORLD FIRST IN THE GREEN LOAN MARKET
In 2022, Crédit Agricole CIB signed with EDF the first transaction in which the funds will be entirely dedicated to investments in the nuclear sector. This is a world first in terms of energy transition. The loan is part of the Grand Carénage, a major industrial programme that aims to improve safety and extend the service life of nuclear reactors beyond 40 years while creating economic activity in the French regions. French nuclear plants produce very low-carbon electricity: 4 g CO2 equivalent per kWh over the life cycle according to a study published by EDF in 2022 and reviewed by independent experts. The nuclear generation activity is authorised by the European Union’s “green activities” classification.

"After working with Crédit Agricole CIB's Sustainable Banking teams to revise our Green Finance Framework to include nuclear power generation – allowed under the EU's green taxonomy – we were delighted to innovate again with Crédit Agricole CIB for this first green loan dedicated to the financing of the fourth 10-yearly visits of nuclear power plants. These visits permit the ongoing production of very low-carbon energy (less than 4 gCO2 /kWh), while maintaining economic activity in the regions concerned." Xavier Girre: EDF Finance Director and Bernard Descreux: Director of Financings and Treasury Management


Mobilising for a more sustainable society
Working together for a more sustainable transition
In addition to helping its clients in their environmental transition and contribut-ing to meet social goals, Crédit Agricole CIB has been involved for many years in thinktanks and working groups in various sectors. The aim is to work together with all stakeholders for a more sustainable transition.
Steel: Crédit Agricole CIB is very active in the steel sector, which is crucial to the econ-omy. Steel is used in all areas, including the energy transition, from cars to public transport rails to low-carbon buildings.

However, because of its dependence on coal, the sector accounts for 7% of global CO2 emissions. With demand for steel set to increase by 30% by 2050, emissions could rise significantly if nothing is done to decarbonise the industry.
Crédit Agricole CIB and five large banks signed the Sustainable STEEL Principles (SSP), the first steel stakeholder agree-ment to develop the methods and data needed to align the steel industry with a net zero trajectory and measure that alignment over time.
Signatories to the Sustainable STEEL Principles represent a combined bank loan portfolio of approximately $23 billion, a market share of over 11% of all loans to the private steel sector. With this innovative and voluntary agreement, Crédit Agricole CIB will be able to con-tinue to serve the steel sector as it moves towards decarbonisation.
Shipping: Crédit Agricole CIB is a signatory to the Poseidon Principles since 2019, an ini-tiative that aims to introduce and then regularly measure climate assessment criteria in future ship finance decisions to encourage decarbonisation of the ship-ping sector.
The aim is to reduce the sector’s total annual GHG emissions by at least 50% by 2050.
The initiative covers all ship-backed loans that fall under the jurisdiction of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), a specialised agency of the United Nations that regulates maritime transport.
Aviation: The aviation sector currently generates 2.5% of all CO2 emissions, while air traffic is expected to increase significantly by 2050. In response, Crédit Agricole CIB societyand six of the largest aviation lenders have joined forces with the Center for Climate-Aligned Finance of the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) to form a work-ing group. The working group’s ambition is to create a climate compliant financial framework that sets common targets for reducing carbon emissions in the aviation sector.
Crédit Agricole CIB’s ambition with this initiative is to provide a robust and effec-tive framework for all stakeholders in aviation finance.

Emerging markets: The Alliance for Green Commercial Banks brings together pioneers of green finance to contribute to its growth in emerging markets by sharing their expe-rience, expertise and financial practices with local banks. This initiative is cur-rently focused on Asia. Recognised for its leadership in the field, Crédit Agricole CIB is the only French bank among the five leading members of this Alliance, which was created by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).
The Alliance brings together financial and research institutions and innovative technology providers to develop a green community in emerging markets that can collectively finance the infrastructure and business solutions needed to address cli-mate and environmental risks.
Given the critical role that green finance plays in the sustainable economic devel-opment of the Asia-Pacific region, Crédit Agricole CIB’s active contribution to the Alliance illustrates its commitment to a sustainable society by stimulating finan-cial innovation, promoting responsible investment and encouraging our clients to opt for the best green strategies.


BETTER UNDERSTANDING AND CONTROLLING OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT AND SPEEDING UP THE TRANSFORMATION OF OUR ORGANISATION
In 2022, the “ESG regulations and commitments” project was launched within the Bank.
The goal was to define and implement the necessary changes and adaptations in Crédit Agricole CIB’s processes in order to comply with new ESG regulations and ensure the steering of the Bank’s commitments, particularly those relating to the Net Zero trajectory. This project involves all business lines. A major awareness-raising and training initiative for employees is also being carried out. For example, “Climate Fresque” workshops are regularly held and a training and certification programme, the “ESG Academy”, was set up.
A simulator to calculate your carbon footprint
The Bank developed a simulator so that employees can calculate their professional carbon footprint in a few minutes. The tool allows them to identify the sources of CO2 emissions linked to their work, transport and consumption habits, and to set their own targets to reduce their carbon footprint.

Working towards a fairer transition
Crédit Agricole CIB supports and encour-ages initiatives in favour of a fairer and more inclusive society. In this regard, socially responsible finance is an addi-tional tool at our disposal to continue to offer sustainable finance solutions to our clients, contributing in a practical and immediate way to projects with a strong social impact.
Acting for socially responsible finance
After launching the world’s first green solidarity bond in May 2021, Crédit Agricole CIB’s Taipei branch issued a new green solidarity bond in August 2022.
This issue includes a socially responsible dimension in the form of a monetary contribution to Plastic Odyssey, a Crédit Agricole Group partner since 2018, to help reduce plastic pollution in the oceans. It will also be used to support UNICEF in its efforts to help children and families who urgently need security, sta-bility and protection in Ukraine.
Encouraging microfinance
In October 2022, Crédit Agricole CIB and the Grameen Crédit Agricole Foundation provided a Rs. 350 million (EUR 4.5 million) Sustainability-Linked Loan to Annapurna Finance, an Indian non-bank financial institution specialised in providing micro-credit to low-income populations.
With this facility, Annapurna Finance is committed to strengthening its environ-mental and social contribution, beyond the inherently social impact of micro-finance, by promoting new solutions to finance the energy transition and the resilience of populations to climate change, and to strengthen women’s entrepreneurship through training.
The Grameen Crédit Agricole Foundation and Crédit Agricole CIB have been working since 2019 to promote finan-cial inclusion through the financing of non-bank institutions in India. For this transaction, the Grameen Crédit Agricole Foundation acted as arranger and guar-antee provider to Crédit Agricole CIB in India, which granted this financing to Annapurna Finance.
In addition, as ESG Coordinator, Crédit Agricole CIB’s Sustainable Banking team advised Annapurna Finance on transition“Solidarity Bankers”, a skills volunteering programme launched by the Grameen Crédit Agricole Foundation and Crédit Agricole S.A. in favour of microfinance institutions and businesses with a social impact supported by the Foundation.
Innovating in the social bond market
Crédit Agricole CIB supported Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) Foreign Exchange Fund, in the issuance of the first ever dual-tranche Hong Kong dollar (HKD) and offshore renminbi (CNH) social bond. This first-of-its-kind social bond consists of a 2-year HKD 8 billion tranche and a 3-year CNH 3 bil-lion tranche.
It will finance or refinance loans under the special 100% SME financing guar-antee scheme, helping to ease the cash flow pressure on small and medium-sized enterprises in Hong Kong during the health crisis, and minimise bankruptcies and layoffs.

"The future of responsible lending is about taking advantage of sustainability practices. This requires strategic decision-making and the use of more environmentally and socially appropriate products. We are confident that this collaboration between Crédit Agricole and Annapurna will help both organisations achieve positive results in terms of sustainable development." Gobinda Chandra Pattanaik: General manager Annapurna Finance

Supporting the transformation of our organisation:
In its Human Project, Crédit Agricole CIB puts employees at the centre of its strategy give them the means to express their potential at the service of our transformation and the Bank’s performance.
Being a responsible employer: Fostering autonomy and empowerment
By developing a managerial culture that fosters empowerment and by offering a working environment that encourages autonomy, collaboration, trust and ini-tiative, the Bank wants to reinforce the empowerment of each individual and the commitment of all employees to serve our clients and society.
Accordingly, and since 2020, Crédit Agricole CIB has been deploying its empowerment approach to accompany the transformation of its business lines and the simplification of its organisation by involving all of its teams in its Human Project. Crédit Agricole CIB wants to encourage its employees’ development and empowerment through a career management process that is jointly built between employees, their managers and their human resources business partner.
Each year, appraisal and goal-setting campaigns are used to review individual and collective performance, and each employee’s achievements and development needs. In 2022, a new application, MyDev, was designed by the Crédit Agricole S.A. Group and launched as a pilot within Crédit Agricole CIB in order to formalise annual appraisals, career development wishes, and goals for the coming year. This new responsibility-based assessment meets employees’ expectations through more regular exchanges and improved professional development.
To support employees in their develop-ment, the Bank has been using the 365T tool since 2021. This allows each employee to identify his or her skills and interests. Simultaneously, the Bank is continuing to expand its open-access digital training offer to allow all its employees to develop their soft skills, linguistic and managerial skills.

More than 1,500 employees involved in this empowerment approach
A new work organisation that
encourages trust and empowerment
Crédit Agricole CIB signed its remote
working agreement in October 2021,
establishing hybrid work as a real way of
working within the Bank. This agreement
is a key step in building new working
methods within all Crédit Agricole CIB
entities. It offers a more flexible and
inclusive framework by making remote
working a lever for efficiency and collective
performance. The implementation of
the remote working agreement is part of
the New ways Of Working (NOW) project.
This project is a major component
of the company’s Human Project, and
aims to provide a working environment
that encourages cooperation, trust and
empowerment, in particular through a
hybrid work organisation, redesigned
work spaces and new tools and applications
to promote cooperation.
The increasingly hybrid nature of work
is based on the one hand on remote
working, which is currently deployed in
all the Bank’s geographical areas, and on
the other hand on the reorganisation of
work spaces via the Smart Office project.
This project aims to redefine our working
environment and offer employees
the spaces best suited to their activities
when they are on site.
The Smart Office project is currently
deployed in France, Frankfurt, New York,
Taipei and London.

Anne-Catherine : Deputy General Manager and Global Head of Human Resources
"We encourage empowerment at all levels of our organisation so that each employee can express his or her potential. 
Since 2020, we have embarked on an approach involving employees, managers and top management teams to promote the development of authentic leadership and the empowerment of employees. 
In 2022, we have continued this empowerment approach, which is a key pillar in our Human Project."

Our transformation is moving forward
In 2022, the set-ups to listen to employees’ views and encourage their participation were strengthened to take into account the many challenges linked to the transformation of society and the ways in which we are organised. 
The Accountability Index (IMR) was therefore implemented for all, replacing the Engagement and Recommendation Index (ERI) that was used in the Group since 2016. 
The set-up was adjusted in 2022, as part of the launch of the Ambitions 2025 strategic plan, in order to measure the managerial, organisational and cultural transformations introduced by the Human Project and to measure employees’ views of the Bank’s social, societal and environmental commitments.
The new IMR has two components: the Quantitative IMR, based on a questionnaire on strategy, managerial culture, CSR commitments, pride of belonging, employer recommendation and quality of life at work, and the Qualitative IMR calculated through the analysis of employees’ verbatim. 
The results of this survey reveal a strong individual and collective commitment from employees and a pride to belong to Crédit Agricole CIB. 
Employees recommend the Bank as a good employer and praise career development opportunities, the quality of the work environment, the human-centric corporate culture and the meaning given to their daily missions

Promoting this diversity is at the heart of our human commitments and is also part of the Group’s strategy of universality, which is implemented in all its entities.
Diversity Month, which takes place every year in November, is a key moment to communicate, reflect and raise awareness among Crédit Agricole CIB employees. It is an opportunity to examine and share ideas on the place of diversity in our company and our daily lives.

105 events organised for students worldwide



During recurring events or one-off missions, employees shared powerful moments in support of a cause serving the general interest. These moments of solidarity, organised in several countries in which Crédit Agricole CIB operates, give employees the opportunity to get involved, while associations can present their projects to the Bank’s employees.
In France, employees took part in individual sporting events such as the Financial community’s Telethon. Over 300 employees covered more than 1,500 km in the race that took place on December 9, 2022 in Paris. Thanks to the United Heroes application, employees from various Crédit Agricole S.A. Group entities were also able to take part in this event online and walk or run individually to collect donations for AFM-Téléthon. Since April 2020, payroll donations allow French employees to donate to selected associations by giving up pennies from their salary via a monthly deduction made at the time of pay. Employees also have the option of adding 1 to 5 euros per month to their donation, with Crédit Agricole CIB matching each donation made. Donations are paid to one of the five selected associations: Hôpital Necker-Enfants malades, Institut Curie, Le Cartable Fantastique, Pure Océan and Entourage.
Through Helping Hands, the Bank pro-vides financial support for charitable projects in which employees are perso-nally involved. The areas of activity are solidarity, social integration, the environ-ment, education or health, in France and abroad. In 2022, 15 employees in France benefited from these “Helping Hands” to achieve their projects, as well as 11 internationally.
Overall, since 2013, the Bank has sup-ported nearly 350 charity projects led by employees, 120 of which were abroad.
In the United States, Crédit Agricole CIB supports The Bowery Mission, which helps people in need, and New York Cares, which focuses on education and children.
In the United Kingdom, the Bank supports the fight against poverty, pre-cariousness and exclusion through the Charity programme.

Continuing our experiments with artificial intelligence
Supporting the transformation of our business lines with the AI Factory
This year, Crédit Agricole CIB launched an entity to develop and speed up the use of Artificial Intelligence (Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Data Analytics, etc.).

Building the finance of the future
Since 2019, Crédit Agricole CIB and Mazars have partnered with Paris Dauphine University's Fintech Chair through a partnership agreement aimed at contributing to the development of knowledge in the field of Fintechs and digital finance.
The challenge is to forge strong links between the partner companies, the talent pool, the academic institutions and university students. The Chair and its partners work together to create an ecosystem combining research, teaching and entrepreneurship in digital finance. Through panel discussions and annual conferences organised in Europe, Asia, North America and Africa, the Chair brings together, alongside its partners, leading academics and professional experts in France and on the world stage, to discuss digital finance issues.
These discussions provide the Chair with outstanding material to reflect on, allowing it to focus its research on practical issues while supporting the rise of cutting-edge entrepreneurial projects. Simultaneously, the Chair is developing its “research and teaching” component by creating courses in digital finance within master’s programmes and by financing a doctoral programme at the University of Paris Dauphine. In addition to their academic and professional significance, these initiatives help create a structured and regulated framework to support digital finance in the long term.
The Chair benefits from Dauphine University’s international academic network and works with recognised players in the Fintech ecosystem to encourage research through calls for projects with a global reach and the annual awarding of a prize for the best article.
Finally, on the entrepreneurial side, the Chair also supports key Fintech events with contests to support innovative projects in their operational deployment. The Chair also works in partnership with the Paris Dauphine incubator to support masters graduates in developing and financing their fintech projects.

Crédit Agricole CIB, gold sponsor of the Singapore Fintech Festival for the 7th consecutive year
To strengthen its international presence in the innovative sector, the Bank once again participated this year in the Singapore Fintech Festival. In 2022, the festival’s theme was “Building resilient business models in the midst of volatility and change”. It was an opportunity to communicate the values of the Crédit Agricole and to demonstrate the importance of the business strategy, particularly on sustainable issues. The Group’s representatives were also pleased to welcome on their stand the French Ambassador to Singapore, Her Excellency, Mrs Minh-Di Tang who spoke about the special relationship between France and Singapore in a number of areas, including banking, innovation, sustainability, talent management and technology. Our participation in this festival as a gold sponsor for the 7th consecutive year is a testimony to our continued commitment to build strength in areas such as digital transformation, innovation and sustainability.
Successful results for two quantum computing experiments
In partnership with European technology leaders in quantum computing, Pasqal and Multiverse Computing, Crédit Agricole CIB conducted two experiments on real use cases in the field of finance. The 2 PoCs (“Proof of Concept”), launched in June 2021, were aimed at evaluating the contribution of an algorithmic approach inspired by quantum computing on the one hand, and the potential of quantum computing for finance on the other, in two areas: the valuation of financial products and the measurement of credit risks. Both experiments were successful. These two PoCs demonstrated the potential and reality of quantum computing for finance, even though quantum computing technologies are still in their infancy.
